UPDATED COPY OF CLASS LICENSING AND REGISTRATION REGULATIONS, 2007 WITH
AMENDMENTS UPTO CURRENT DATE

Dear Public Information Officer

Thank you for your prompt Response, and especially for emailing a copy of the Response. It
was most helpful and allowed me to send this follow up quickly. You do not have to physically
mail me copies of your responses unless you prefer it—an email alone is sufficient and | will
always acknowledge receipt.

In my Request, | asked for:

[AJn up-to-date copy of the Class Licensing and Registration Regulations, 2007, including
all amendments, enforced by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority today.

| do not wish to amend my Request, however, please note these supplementary elaborations.
These are merely clarifications to aid in the search of the record and do not extend the scope
of my original request:

1. The PTA has in its possession a single, finalized, fully amended and “up-to-date” copy
of the Class Licensing and Registration Regulations 2007 “including all amendments”
that it enforces today.

2. This document is the final regulation PTA has created when we accumulate the net
total effect of PTA’s notifications related to Class Licensing and Registration
Regulations 2007 and Class Value Added Services Licensing and Registration
Regulations 2007.

3. This document is not a notification published in the Gazette of Pakistan, but a body of
text containing the final version of the regulations that are “enforced by the Pakistan
Telecommunication Authority today”
4. By virtue of being a regulation, this document is a public record under section 5(b) of
the Right of Access to Information Act 2017.

5. That document has not been published on its website.

6. That very document is the subject of my Request.

In your Response, you stated:

It is submitted that, Class Licensing and Registration Regulations along with amendments
are available on PTA’s Website at S.No. 1, 2, 12, 20 and 38.

The PTA’s website, at https://www.pta.gov.pk/en/laws-&-policies/regulations, contains the
following (arranged in chronological order):

1. Serial number 2: Class Value Added Services Licensing and Registration Regulations
2007, Gazette of Pakistan Extraordinary. 11 July 2007;

2. Serial number 1: S. R. O. 56(I)/2008, “amendments in the Regulations”, Gazette of
Pakistan Extraordinary. 16 January 2008;

3. Serial number 12: Class Licensing and Registration (Amendment) Regulations, 2008,
Gazette of Pakistan Extraordinary. 27 October 2008;

4. Serial number 20: Class Licensing and Registration (Amendment) Regulations, 2010,
Gazette of Pakistan Extraordinary. 3 May 2010; and

5. Serial number 38: Class Licensing and Registration (Amendment) Regulations, 2016,
Gazette of Pakistan Extraordinary. 4 April 2016.

None of these are “/Ajn up-to-date copy of the Class Licensing and Registration Regulations,
2007” as was the subject of my Request.

| hope | was able to clear any confusion and explain exactly which record is required. As
always, you may send me a reply in writing to my address above, or preferably via email to
amin@gilani.me. | am still available for any clarifications to the Request that you may require.

Sincerely,

Syed Muhammad Amin Gilani

Dear Public Information Officer

Thank you very much for your cooperation and for providing the Information. | appreciate the
promptness with which you answered my request and the fact that you communicated via
email when possible. This was a refreshingly bright interaction with my Government.

While my Request has been satisfied, please note that by virtue of section 5 of the Right of
Access to Information Act, 2017', you, as the Public Information Officer, must ensure this
Information is “duly published including uploading over the Internet“. The same must be true
of all other information that falls under the scope of section 5 of the same act. This has been
reiterated by the Federal Information Commission in their circular on proactive disclosure’.

| urge you to publish this and all other regulations by the PTA in their fully amended forms
online, and not just as their component iterative Gazette notifications, as is required by law.

Sincerely,

Syed Muhammad Amin Gilani
